    <p style="color: grey">The Mandalorian is my favorite Star Wars character for a lot of different reasons!<br>
      The first thing I think of is his ice cold demeanor. Nothing bothers him or phases him and he always gets the job done. But he also has a soft side that we see come out more and more.<br>
      His design is also so unique and iconic. Even among so many different Mandalorians-- his is super distinct. I think that's a credit to the art/design department.<br>
      Finally, he represents a new age of Star Wars that gives many fans of the original trilogy hope for new Star Wars projects. Many people haven't liked the sequel trilogy for many different reasons, so The Mandalorian is a huge relief and breath of fresh air.
