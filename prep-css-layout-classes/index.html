        way around the world trying to learn more about bending the elements so that Aang can defeat the oppressive firelord. The
        season ends with our heroes in the North Pole, learning new bending and defending the North Pole from the Fire Nation's siege.</p>

        <p>
          Season 2 of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> follows our protagonists as they further learn to harness their powers.
          Aang still needs to master the earth and fire elements, and during this process, they eventually learn of a solar eclipse
          that will weaken the Fire Nation and so they decide to go to Ba Sing Se to tell the Earth King. Unbeknownst to our heroes,
          Ba Sing Se has been infiltrated, and the new abilities Aang learns backfire. The season ends on a somber note, but still following our heroes.

        <p>
          The final season of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> starts with our heroes in the darkest of places. They are barely
          scraping by on their own. They decide to infiltrate the Fire Nation while undercover and defeat the Fire Lord during the solar eclipse.
          Unfortunately, the attack fails, our heroes retreat again, and they end up making an ally out of a previous foe. The series ends with
          Aang mastering all 4 elements and not needing to kill the Fire Lord, but neutralizing his powers instead. Peace is brought once more to all 4 nations
          thanks to the avatar.
